Hololive Virtual Youtuber /vt/ Mascots for OneeChan

These are a set of "mascots" for 4chan X/OneeChan (both userscripts are required to use).

# Install

- First, install Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey/etc, any compatible userscript manager.
- Next, install 4chan X from this repository: [ccd0/4chan X](https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x) - further instructions are there if you have trouble for this step
- Then, install OneeChan, the one I use and know is compatible is [KevinParnell/OneeChan](https://github.com/KevinParnell/OneeChan)
- Open the 4chan or 4channel website, click on the "Gears" at the top right, then click on Import at the bottom of the popup.
- Navigate to where you have saved/cloned the vtubers.json file.  Note **this will OVERWRITE any custom mascots you currently have**.  It should not change any other settings, but you should back up your settings just to be sure (export).
- Go back into OneeChaan settings (Gears) and go to mascots, appended to the bottom should be a bunch of /vt/ mascots, make sure to select the ones you want and deselect the ones you don't (one non-/vt/ mascot is automatically selected by default).
